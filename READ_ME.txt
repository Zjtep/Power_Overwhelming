1. Make sure you go into RS_V2.java, scroll down to line 808.
	- You need to figure out the correct x and y location. 
	- When the x any y locations are correct. If you fight 
	  other players or NPC, you should see their health 
          bar get correctly tracked. This is very important 
          since the infromation is pixel based!

2. Opps.....I think I left the weights file in...
   	- How do you delete files on window?!??!?!
	- I dont know how to do that...looks like I will have
	  to leave the weight file in this project :(

3. Python Libaries for PYTHON 3.6
   - TensorFlow GPU
   - Keras 
   - No point in doing any traning since I left the weights
     file in "accidently" :(

4. MAKE SURE YOU DO STEP 1....It might be a pain...but you need to do it
   - You can make this process easier if you move the screen 
     to a specific locaiton where you can move it to every time. 
   - I kept aligning it with one of the desktop icons. 
   - I kept it 1 pixel over so I knew I was doing it right every time.
